<h3>First of all, What is UX</h3>
<p>Well.Let’s start by defining UX, which stands for “user experience.” When we say “user experience,” we’re referring to how people interact with a product. For an example, when we want to turn on a light in our room, we interact with a light switch. The design of the switch — including the color, material, and physical appearance — may impact how we feel about the interaction.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the digital design world, UX refers to everything that affects a user’s interaction with a digital product such as mobile applications, websites, an operating system likewise.</p>
<h2>UX Principles</h2>

    <li>Match between System and the Real World</li>
    <li>User Control and Freedom</li>
    <li>Accessibility</li>
    <li>Consistency and Standards</li>
    <li>Recognition Rather than Recall</li>
    <li>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</li>
    <li>Aesthetics and Minimalist Design</li>
    <li>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors</li>
    <li>Help and Documentation</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.Meet the User’s Need</h4>

<p>UX Design is user-centred, so first and foremost you have to ensure that the design meets the needs of the user. Your design should help the users achieve their desired outcome seamlessly.</p>


<h4>2.Hierarchy</h4>

<p>Hierarchy refers to how the content or information is organized throughout the design. Which screen comes before the others? Which elements or information need more attention than others? Hierarchy controls the order in which information is consumed and processed. A design with clear hierarchy helps users easily scan for the information they need and go about their tasks smoothly.</p>

<h4>3.Visibility of System Status</h4>

<p>Users should be able to receive feedback on the actions they take. Your design should provide them with information on what is going on and show users their system status. If a user is downloading a file, a good design should show some sort of progress bar to show how much time is left for the download to complete instead of leaving the user in the dark.</p>

<h4>4.Match between System and the Real World</h4>

<p>Your design should speak the language of the user and use the same concept that people are already familiar with in the real world. Avoid the use of jargon or technical terms, simple language makes your design easier to understand. Likewise, elements used in a design should be similar to what they represent in the real world, for example, the trashcan icon in Gmail tells the user where to find deleted emails.<p>


<h4>5.User Control and Freedom</h4>

<p>The design should give users control in the process, allow them to redo, undo and cancel an action that they have already taken. A product that considers this principle is Google docs. You can undo changes you have made to a document and redo any change you reversed.</p>

<h4>6.Accessibility</h4>

<p>Your design should be usable for as many people as possible. It should be accessible by people with disabilities like visual impairments. Texts should have a clear contrast to the background, avoid using colours that can’t be seen by everyone.</p>

<h4>7.Consistency and Standards</h4>

<p>Your design should follow standards and use consistent concepts throughout the entire product. This allows users to become familiar with new products, so they know what actions to take without any extra learning. Take a look at products from Microsoft office, they have a general look and feel. So if you know how to use Microsoft Word, adopting Microsoft Powerpoint or Spreadsheet would be easier and faster.</p>

<h4>8.Recognition Rather than Recall</h4>

<p>It is easier to recognize things than to recall them. Your design should keep options, actions, etc visible to reduce the load on the users’ memory. Users should not have to remember information from one display to another. A website that keeps requesting for your username and password every time you use it can be frustrating. Try searching for a video on Youtube, notice how the several options are listed before you are done typing. Now, imagine if you had to remember the title of a video on Youtube before you can find it. Frustrating, right?</p>

<h4>9.Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</h4>

<p>The design of a product should be such that it can be used by new and expert users. It should be easy for new users to learn and have shortcuts for experts to do things fast. Let’s look at Figma, a tool for designing user interfaces. New Figma users might click on the shapes tools to pick out a shape to use in their design while an expert would press R on the keyboard for rectangle, O for an ellipse, e.t.c</p>

<h4>10.Aesthetics and Minimalist Design</h4>

<p>Less is more. Don’t overwhelm users with unnecessary or irrelevant information. A minimalist design helps users focus on their goals without getting distracted by the design. Information should not be competing with one another for the users’ attention. Each screen should contain only components relevant to the task being carried out and provide clear and visible means to navigate to other content.</p>

<h4>11.Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors.</h4>

<p>Error messages should be straightforward, actionable and in plain language. The design should tell the users what went wrong and offer solutions. Have you ever tried loading a website but got a page saying, “404 Not Found”? Not everyone knows what this error means. This is an example of an error message that isn’t useful. Now, try watching a video on Youtube without an internet connection. Youtube would not only tell you that you are offline but would also suggest that you retry connecting to the internet or go to your downloads to watch a video. Youtube gives an error message that is easy to understand as well as suggesting solutions.</p>

<h4>12.Help and Documentation</h4>

<p>Most times users might want to navigate a product without resorting to documentation but sometimes documentation is necessary. Such documentation should be easy to locate and focused on the users’ current task. Your design should provide help to users where they need it and when they actually need it.</p>

<h3>Most Common miscomponents about ux design</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>User interface design, it is the system</li>
    <li>A step in the process, it is the process</li>
    <li>just about technology,it is about behavior</li>
    <li>just about the user,it is about context</li>
    <li>just about the usability,it is about the value</li>
    <li>Expensive,It is flexible</li>
    <li>Easy,it is a balancing</li>
    <li>A single discipline,it is a collaboration</li>
    <li>A choice,it is a means of survival</li>
 </ul>


<p>Ux design is not, user Interface design it’s the system
User experience isn’t a layer or component of a product or service.It’s really about the design of whole systems and their interconnections.</p>

<p>User experience design not a step in process, it is the process
Ux design is isn’t a checkbox. You don’t do it and then move on. It needs to be integrated into everything you do.</p>

<p>Ux design is not just about the technology.t is about the behavior
Ux experience design is not limited to the confines of the computer.It’s doesn’t even need a screen. User experience is any interaction with any product, any artifact, any system.</p>

<p>Ux is not about just about usability.it is about the value
While usability is important , its focus on efficiency and effectiveness seems to blur the other important factors in ux,
Which include learnability and visceral and behavioral emotional responses to the products and services we use.</p>

<p>Ux design is not just about the user.
We just can’t always do what is best for the users.There are a set of business objectives the are needing
to be met-and we are designing to that’s well.</p>

<p>User Experience design is not expensive.it is flexible.
Sometimes a fully fledged , formal UCD process may not be the best thing to try first time. It’s extremely important-and totally possible no matter where you are working or when you are arrive on a project to make small improvements to both the project and the product by introducing some user experience design techniques.</p>


<p>Ux is not the role of one person or department.
Ux is not just the responsibility of a department or a person .that compartmentalist view of ux is evidence that is not part of the organizational culture and hints to teams not having a common goal or vision for the experience they should deliver collectively.</p>

<p>Ux design is not A single discipline
User experience may not even be a community just yet.At best, it is a common awareness, a thread that ties together people from different disciplines who care about good design, and who realize that today’s increasingly complex design challenges require the synthesis of different varieties of design expertise.</p>


<p>User experience design is not a choice.
The biggest misconception is that companies have a choice to invest in Thier user’s experience. To survive, they don’t.</p>
