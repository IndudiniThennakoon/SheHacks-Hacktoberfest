**What is Low-code?**

Low code is a software development approach that requires little to no coding to build applications and processes.

Instead of using complex programming languages, you can employ visual interfaces with basic logic and drag-and-drop capabilities in a low code development platform.

Users with no advanced knowledge of coding or software creation may use these intuitive techniques to build software for several purposes, such as creating mobile and business applications.

As they are a quick and simple alternative to conventional software development, these platforms have grown in popularity. A low-code framework can be used by technical and “citizen developers” (non-professional development) to build applications of a wide variety to fulfil market demands for growth, simplify processes, and facilitate digital transformation.

**What is Low-code development?**

Instead of conventional hand-coded computer programming, a low-code development framework offers a programming environment for creating software applications via graphical user interfaces and configuration.

Low-code creation frameworks provide IT customers the ability to incorporate building blocks into workflows and apps. These basic elements abstract away the code behind actions and orders, allowing IT to create interfaces and business applications without having to code them by hand.

**Features of low code development**

_Visual modelling tools_

It takes less time to create apps using visual approaches and templates than developing apps using code. Low-code systems, which are equipped with visual modeling features, use built-in modules to reflect the details in a way that everyone may understand – from non-technical enterprise users to advanced developers.

_Out-of-the-box functionality_

OOTB (out-of-the-box) software is provided by leading low-code platforms, which removes the need to create key components for applications from the start. Some low code systems, for example, provide data storage or customer-facing app components, such as service management or sales process management.

_Drag-and-drop interface_

Drag-and-drop functionality is available on any well-known low code platform. It is one of the most critical and valuable functionalities that facilitates the production process. The convenience drag-and-drop features offers throughout the development of apps supports both citizen developers and technical developers.

_Security_

A low-code tool that isn’t safe isn’t a sufficient solution, no matter how usable or user-friendly it is. Before you start using your low-code development framework, make sure it has enough protection to secure the applications you’re creating and the platform as a whole.

_Scalability_

Scalability is essential for low-code systems. It should create applications that can accommodate a rise in users as your company will expand. It should be able to accommodate twenty as well as twenty thousand employees.

**Types of Low-Code Development Platforms**

Depending on what your requirement is, there are different categories of low-code platforms that can be more suited to the task at hand. Broadly, they are classified into five different categories.

- General Purpose
- Request Handling
- Process
- Mobile First
- Database

Forrester has categorized all low-code platforms into these five categories, depending on what they’re designed to do. But for the most part, general purpose low-code platforms are what most people will need, since they’re designed to replace low level coding platforms like .NET and Java.

But this is where the low-code train starts to slow down. Since there is one obvious flaw in low-code platforms.

**What is the difference between low code and no-code development?**

The basic difference between both platforms is that low-code targets developers. These systems necessitate technological skills but enable skilled coders to work more quickly. For coders, the more efficient the tools for speeding up technological progress, the better.


On the other hand, no-code targets business users because these platforms don’t allow users to manually edit code while focusing on providing the safest and most user-friendly interface possible when abstracting technical information. The more intuitive the user interface is, the better it is for enterprise users.

The other difference is the trade-off. Since they are designed to build a vast range of technical solutions, low-code systems do need some coding. Coding is also a vital part of the construction process to ensure that the creator has the power they need. No-code platforms, on the other hand, abstract away all technological information. It renders no-code platforms even cheaper and simpler to use, even though they are only available for a few use-cases.

What can you build with low-code?
Businesses can build any web and mobile application using a low-code platform. The most common types of low-code applications are:

Legacy modernization applications
Workspace application
Operation improvement application
How can you choose the first low-code project?
Here are some guidelines to choose your first low-code project:

Understand all the Low-code use cases

Map out the problems and requirements of the project according to the use case
Find out what will take the least amount of time and resources
Start your project

Benefits of a Low-Code Development Platform

Low-code implementation will quickly yield observable results for the business. Here are some of the most significant advantages of using a low-code development platform:

Quicker time to market: Creating a custom-built app or a smartphone app is a time-consuming and dynamic process. Low-code platforms, on the other hand, greatly shorten the production time.

Access control: Business users can conveniently grant access to their programme using a low-code platform. On both the broad and micro level, users can monitor who has access to the application. Users may be designated as administrators, co-owners, or end-users by the application creator.

Less cost: Conventionally making software – that is, manually coding each part of the system – is difficult, requires time, and costly. On the other hand, low-code platforms allow for the development of more applications in less time, lowering the cost of the process.

Low-code systems are the perfect blend of democratization and power. If you have big plans for the technological capabilities of your company, you need to seriously look at low code platforms. Read more benefits here
