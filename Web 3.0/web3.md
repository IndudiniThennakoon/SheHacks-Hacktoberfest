The evolution of the web is often divided into three seperate stages:
     _Web 1.0 , Web 2.0 , Web 3.0_

This post will break down how has the web evolved over the years, and more omportantly - Where is it going next ?

**Web 1.0 (1989 - 2005)**

The Static Web - It was the first and most reliable internet in the 1990s despite only offering access to limited information with little to no user interaction.

Experts refer to it as the "read-only" web. which is significantly a source of information and a research guide.

**Web 2.0 (2005-Present)**

The social web-made the internet a lot more interactive thanks to advancements in web technologies like javascript, HTML5, CSS3, etc., which enabled startups to build interactive web platforms such as Youtube, Facebook, Wikipedia, and many more.

Web 2.0 websites enable users to create, share, collaborate, and communicate their work with others, without a need for any web design or publishing skills. These capabilities were not present in the web 1.0 environment.

**Web 3.0 (Yet to come)**

Web 3.0 is the next stage of the web evolution that would make the internet more intelligent or process information with near-human-like intelligence through the power of AI systems that could run smart programs to assist users.

Web 3.0 offers distributed data across networks so there is no single entity that owns the user information.

Web 3.0 will bring us a fairer internet by enabling the individual to be a sovereign- users hold maximum power. 

Web 3.0's decentralized blockchain protocol will enable individuals to connect to an internet where they can own and be properly compensated for their time and data.

**Do you think Web 3.0 will revolutionize the internet?**
